    <h1>How I went from Human to Computer Communication</h1>
    <h2>The journey of my life as communications nerd</h2>

    <p>Here I'll talk about growing up bilingually.</p>

    <p>Here's I'll talk about becoming a technical writer and scientific translator and how these two jobs reflect my two passions: Technology and Politics from the point of view of a communications nerd.</p>

    <p>My trip into digitalism is the first time that I can combine these two passions, as I'm learning, studying, and working to become a web developer within the context of open source, leftist web development projects.</p>
